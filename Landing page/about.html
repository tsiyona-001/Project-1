            <h1>Little About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello, Iâ€™m <strong>Tsion Humnesa</strong>, a teenage dreamer from the heart of Ethiopia
            and I am thrilled to share my dress collection with you. Design has been a part of my life since I was a child, a fascination that started with drawing and grew into a love for constructing garments from the ground up. I have spent countless hours cutting and sewing, experimenting and learning (much to my mother's
                chagrin at times!), and it is this journey that has led me to create this collection. I hope you will enjoy discovering the details of my work. If my designs inspire you and you want to explore more, feel free to get in touch.</p>
